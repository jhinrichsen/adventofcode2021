= Advent of Code 2021

[index]
== Index

My take on https://adventofcode.com/2021/ in Go. As usual, i don't particularly
care if i provide my solutions _fast_, i try to be _correct_ on the first
answer, and care for being runtime efficient.
All puzzles are backed by unit testing the examples, and by some benchmarks.

Expected results are hard coded into the unit tests, so unless you are peeking
for a solution avoid looking at those.

<1> I started on the weekend following Dec 1

== Day 1: Sonar Sweep

Nice and easy one. Parsing numbers happens so often i extended my helper file
`input.go` with an additional function that directly returns an array of
integers.

----

To put 1.33 ns/op in perspective: without I/O, meaning excluding time for
reading puzzle input, the time it takes to solve part #1 is 1 μs.
Or, put the other way around, it solves part #1 one million times per second.

Go 1.17 introduces the use of register calling, but as most of my solutions are
in one function this is not a real difference to previous Go releases.

package adventofcode2021

func Day01Part1(ns []int) int {
    count := 0
    for i := 1; i < len(ns); i++ {

            count++
        }
    }
    return count

Let's double check how this transfers to assembler.
Remember Go has its own assembler opcodes.
Even if you can recite chapter 'Conditional Jump' on page 64 of
https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/24592.pdf[AMD64 Reference] woken up at
3:30am in the middle of the night completely drunk, you will not find JLS.
For the time being, one needs to refer to Go internal source code to find the
mappings for
https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/master/src/cmd/asm/internal/arch/arch.go#145[
JLS]:

[source,go]
----
    instructions["JLS"] = x86.AJLS  /* lower or same (unsigned) (CF = 1 || ZF = 1) */
----

The https://go.dev/doc/asm[Quick Guide to Go's assembler] is a useful read to
understand this snippet.

slice, BX is `len()`,
CX is `cap()`. `cap()` is not used in this function, so the compiler uses CX for
index `i`.
<3> return result via register, no stack cleanup required

== Day 2: Dive!

== Day 3: Binary Diagnostic

No brainer. The only noticable piece is maybe the use of closures to avoid deep
structures surrounded by an `if/else`:

----
    if part1 {
        // 10 lines of complicated business logic
    // including more indent levels
    } else {
        // 15 lines of complicated business logic
    // including more indent levels
    }
----

can be replaced using closures (anonymous inner functions)

----
    if part1 {
        fn1()
    } else {
        fn2()
    }
----

which is easier on the eyes.

== Day 4: Giant Squid

Part 1 Blattschuss.

Part2: one miss. My index was working when cutting input file into boards for
example input, but it was wrong and created 120 boards (the last 20 being empty)
instead of 100 boards when used on the read puzzle input for part 2.


Another gotcha: dynamically resizing a slice in a struct does not work, even
when passed via pointer receiver.

----
type S struct {
    A []int
}

func (a *S) add(i int) {
    a.A = append(a.A, i) // does not work
}

----

1.8 ms, excluding I/O, including parsing.

== Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture

Took me 30 min for part 1 and then another 60 min for part 2. The implementation
transparently handles both part 1 and part 2 using

----
diagonal := func(c1, c2 complex128) bool {
        return real(c1) != real(c2) && imag(c1) != imag(c2)
}

// for part 1, only consider horizontal or vertical lines
if part1 && diagonal(src, dst) {
        continue

That is 46 ms for part 2, excluding I/O, including parsing, for 500 lines and a
total of 203660 coordinates, averaging to 230 ns per coordinate. 230*10^-9.

Using integer based arithmetic instead of complex numbers is a little bit
faster, it completes at 87% of the time the complex implementation requires.

approach of counting each lanternfish separate.

20 μs, this time including I/O and parsing, or 50_000 solutions per second.

There is one superfluous bound check at runtime, an array of lines is passed
although we only expect one single line of comma separated values:

If we expect exactly one line, it should be part of the function's signature.
This is not a premature optimization, it is part of the contract.

In addition, if the algorithm requires a list of numbers, it should be stated
so. Parsing from a comma separated list of string values is duty of the caller.
Of course we provide `ParseCommaSeparatedNumbers()` for this exact use case.

[source,go]
----
func Day06(fishes []int, days uint) (uint, error) {

So instead of 20 μs, we are down to 1 μs, and reduced 8 allocations to 0.

<1> No more bound checking on input

There is one more bound check in

    ages[fishes[i]]++

We are using the input itself to index into the `ages` array, which the compiler
obviously cannot verify.

Verification:

[source,go]
----
21 func Day06(fishes []int, days int) (uint, error) {
22         const groups = 8
23         var ages [groups + 1]uint // 0..7 plus babies in 8
24         for i := 0; i < len(fishes); i++ {
25                 ages[fishes[i]]++
26         }
----

Now, there is a shortcut for checking for bound checking.
Instead of looking at the disassembly, one can

----
go build -gcflags="-d=ssa/check_bce/debug=1" day06.go
./day06.go:25:7: Found IsInBounds
----

The message is a bit misleading for my taste, what the compiler is telling us is
that line #25 requires bound checking.

What if we provide some more information about our `fishes` universe?
We expect ages from 0..7, so what if we hint `ages[fishes[i] % groups]`?

[source,go]
----
21 func Day06(fishes []int, days int) (uint, error) {
22         const groups = 8
23         var ages [groups + 1]uint // 0..7 plus babies in 8
24         for i := 0; i < len(fishes); i++ {
25                 ages[fishes[i]%groups]++
26         }
----

----
go build -gcflags="-d=ssa/check_bce/debug=1" day06.go
./day06.go:25:7: Found IsInBounds
----

Nearly there, but still checking.
x % 8 does not necessarily result in `0..7`.
If x is of type `int`, it can be negative, and `-3 % 8 = -3`, so the compiler is
right to keep checking.
One more try, this time using `uint` instead of `int` fishes:

----
 21 func Day06(fishes []uint, days uint) (uint, error) {
 22         const groups = 8
 23         var ages [groups + 1]uint // 0..7 plus babies in 8
 24         for i := 0; i < len(fishes); i++ {
 25                 ages[fishes[i]%groups]++
 26         }
----

Great, no more bound checking.

== Day 10: Syntax Scoring

== Day 11: Dumbo Octopus

== Day 12: Passage Pathing

== Day 13: Transparent Origami

Using Jetbrains IDEA Ultimate in combination with Junie running Sonnet 4.
A major pain in the neck.
I ask for a review of the CONTRIBUTING.md document, and Junie starts refactoring day 11 test cases.
It always does WAY more than asked for, and acts like a young dog that chews your sofa and pisses on the carpet.
It needs constant corrections, repeated limits, my experience is really bad.

Like i ask it a question, but i get no answer.
image::assets/Screenshot From 2025-08-04 19-14-27.png[]

But in the end we have a unit tests for the example, and for part 1.
image::assets/Screenshot From 2025-08-04 20-09-30.png[]

=== Baseline

These generated sources are our baseline, they are available from this repository in `assets/junie-sonnet4/day13.go` resp. `assets/junie-sonnet4/day13_test.go`.

=== An opinionated source code review created by Junie/ Sonnet4 by a senior Go programmer

As a prerequisite, Junie was prompted to follow the rules set forth in CONTRIBUTING.md.
We can argue if performance should have such a high priority, but this is a given prerequisite.
If your financial controller tells you to cut down on deployments costs, no debates.

==== `day13.go`

[source,go]
----
// Point represents a coordinate on the transparent paper
type Point struct {
    X, Y int
}
----

This has vague similarity to `image.Point` from the stdlib.

[source,go]
----
type Point struct {
    X, Y int
}
----

The struct is removed, and replaced with an import.

Next is a Fold struct

[source,go]
----
// Fold represents a fold instruction
type Fold struct {
    Axis  string // "x" or "y"
    Value int
}
----

which is used to hold the fold section in puzzle input

----
fold along x=655
fold along y=447
----

The axis representation as a `string`, well,

[source,go]
----
        if fold.Axis == "y" {
----

Given that

- we have a 2D system, so the only instances are x and y
- the value is always positive

not very effective.
Instead, we represent the first axis (X) as positive numbers, and the second axis (Y) as negative numbers.

The section is another struct,

[source,go]
----
type Day13Data struct {
    Dots     map[image.Point]bool
    Folds    []int
    DotCount int
}
----

Using `Data` as part of the name is kindof DRY, but ok, Day13 is already taken.
The struct carries the binary representation of the puzzle input from the Parser to the Solver.
`DotCount` is just `len(Dots)`.
This is both error prone, and superfluous, and unused.
Unused - the declaration and the one single initialization can safely be removed.
This leaves us with a struct holding two fields, in a language like Go that supports multiple return types not necessary.

From

[source,go]
----
day13.go:// Day13Data holds the parsed input for Day 13
day13.go:type Day13Data struct {
day13.go:func NewDay13(lines []string) Day13Data {
day13.go:func Day13(data Day13Data, part1 bool) uint {
----

we refactor to

[source,go]
----
day13.go:func NewDay13(lines []string) (map[image.Point]bool, []int) {
day13.go:func Day13(dotsIn map[image.Point]bool, folds []int, part1 bool) uint {
----

Dots are kept in a sparse map with value type `bool`, which is standard Go Set handling.
The one disadvantage lies in the interpretation of a map key that exists, but is set to false - is this a Point?
Good for triple logic, but not required here, so we refactor.

[source,go]
----
map[image.Point]bool     <1>
map[image.Point]struct{} <2>
----
<1> entry level
<2> expert level (zero allocation)

So far we have erased everything we came across - the best code is code that is not written.
Now, for the signature of the Parser, it does not return an `error` type.

[source,go]
----
func NewDay13(lines []string) (map[image.Point]struct{}, []int) {
----

which is unusual because even in our well behaved environment (we do not expect malign input) there is always something going wrong.
The parsing logic is straightforward, using stdlib `TrimSpace`, `Split`, `Atoi`, reading the two sections one after another, toggling on the interim empty line.
But it silently skips handling a couple of conditions that i would not dare to ignore.

[source,go]
----
if strings.HasPrefix(line "fold along ") {
    ...
} <1>

if len(parts) == 2 {
    ....
} <1>

value, _ := strconv.Atoi(...) <2>
----
<1> no else condition
<2> ignore errors

Next in line is `Day13` solver, which looks pretty standard.
It creates a copy of the input map to avoid modifying original data.
One nice feature: when passing either one fold or many folds as a slice, `folds[:1`] is like `folds[0]` but a slice.

[source,go]
----
foldsToApply := folds
if part1 {
    // Part 1: only apply the first fold
    foldsToApply = folds[:1]
}

for _, fold := range foldsToApply {
    dots = applyFold(dots, fold)
}
----

I find this more concise:

[source,go]
----
for _, fold := range folds {
    dots = applyFold(dots, fold)
    // Part 1: only apply the first fold
    if part1 {
        break
    }
}
----

On to `applyFold`, again pretty standard.
Creates a copy of the input data to avoid modification.
Then checks for a `0` fold, which is very good, but has no error handling and silenty does nothing

[source,go]
----
if fold == 0 {
    return dots
}
----

This should rather be an error case in the parser, as it could be an indicator for an unintialized value.
The folding itself is just a new translated `image.Point`:

[source,go]
----
newPoint = image.Point{X: 2*line - point.X, Y: point.Y} <1>
newPoint = image.Point{X: point.X, Y: 2*line - point.Y} <2>
----
<1> X axis fold
<2> Y axis fold

==== `day13_test.go`

Junie created the required examples #1, example #2, and part 1 test cases, and also created the benchmark for part 1.
The one existing benchmark (for now) calls a `bench13` function, the three existing tests do not use this pattern.
The `bench13` function correctly identifies as a test helper function:

[source,go]
----
func bench13(b *testing.B, part1 bool) {
    b.Helper()
----

Junie does not use range-over-int (since Go 1.22) although contributing rules clearly state to use the full feature set for the version in `go.mod`.

Junie did not locate the `exampleFilename()` utility function from `input.go` referenced in the contributing rules.
The test case for the first example uses the correct expected solution, `want := uint(17)` as described in the puzzle example.
The use of a dedicated variable including a type case is not useful, better use `const want = 17`.
The puzzle description then uses a second fold, but hints to focus on the first fold only and the expected 17.
Junie created a second fold and counted 16 points after the second fold.
Exhaustive, not required, but we all know this will be the upcoming part 2.

=== Optimization

==== P1: remove superfluous fluff (structs and the like)

This is our baseline

PASS
ok      gitlab.com/jhinrichsen/adventofcode2021 1.193s
----

After refactoring, without any optimization, we get this:

----

----

We already shaved off 10% by just simplifying, not optimizing.
Memory consumption has decreased marginally.

==== P2: No stdlib in Parser

Removing the stdlib (`Strip`, `Trim`, `Split`, `Atoi`) from the Parser, and replacing it with an optimized parser for our use case (e.g. no parsing of negative number, no NaN, no -Inf):

----

<3> number of allocations down by 95%

==== 3. 2D grid representation of points

Junie decided to keep Pointes in a sparse hashmap.
We are using image.Point, but the standard library offers no support for flipping images, and we do not want to introduce third party libraries that can do image flipping.
Using a 2D grid instead of a sparse Hashmap shows a steep decrease in performance:

==== 4. 1D representation

Go does not support 2D arrays, so creating a 2D array is creating a 1D y array and then N times creating 1D x arrays.
For our use case this can easily create thousands of array allocations.
As an alternative, we can create a 1D array of size width * height, and use linear access (`y * w + x`):

==== 5. Bitset representation

Using a bit as the underlying datatype, comparable to the bool value, but bool will be packed into a byte, and a bit
physically is one bit.

==== 6. Bit based calculations based on 64 bit words

This is as close as we get to the CPU, directly use the full 64 bits of a word in the CPU, including native bit operations.
The algorithm must take extra care of underused and overlapping bits in a word.

Time for a short wrapup:

This shows very nicely the tradeoff betwenn perfect runtime and perfect memory consumption, pick one.
The sparse hashmap is fast but memory intensive, it creates 943 * 187 KiB for one operation, i.e. 170 MiB/op.
The optimized parser is slightly faster, it optimizes away some generalizations in string processing that do not exist in our use case.
The main advantage of the custom parser is it brings down memory consumption from 170 MiB/op down to 8 MiB/op.
Factor 20 means you can run your service on all working days for a complete month, instead of just one day.

The 1D representation is slower, it has no sparse points as in the hashmap, it needs to churn on the complete virtual grid.
One memory allocation increases drastically (a complete grid versus a sparse hashmap), but only 4 allocations are required, so memory consumption is 9 MiB/op.

When using bits instead of bool, we are really using one bit to represent a lit point.
Comparing 1D (bool) to 1D (bits), it shows the same characteristics except for the bytes/alloc.
We are now packing 8 bits into a byte, so the number of allocations is the same.
The bytes/op drops from 2320.3 KiB to 204.2 KiB, which is a factor of 7.36, very close to the number of bits we are packing into what we use for bool (8).

As the last alternative, we do not operate on dedicated bits, but use the full CPU length of 64 bit.
Runtime drops by a factor of 3.5, slight drop in bytes/op of 10%, and a massive drop in number of allocations from 943 to 3, factor 314.
These factors are cumulative, 3.5 times 314 is 1.100.
Duplicate this factor, because if GC kicks in we not only need to setup memory, we also need to tear down memory, so we end up with a factor of 2.200.
If the budget for running the baseline lasts for one day, the optimized version will run for 6 years.

== Day 15: Chiton

_tldr; GPT-5 is an awesome beast_

Using Windsurf 1.11.3 and the brand new GPT-5 (low reasoning).
As usual, the first prompt after starting Windsurf is

----
Me:

implement adventofcode 2021 day 15 part 1 examples following the rules in contributing.md.
just all given  examples for part 1, nothing else.
----

Off we go. Thought processes (you can actually look into GPT-5's brain, it's transparent) are marked as notes:

NOTE: Planning example tests for AoC
I need to implement example tests for AoC 2021 Day 15 Part 1, following the contributing guidelines.
I'll add the tests with quoted comments that include expected values.
Since the repo is available locally, I'll edit the necessary code files.
I'll use tools to search for day15 files and tests and likely add the example tests in day15_test.go.
It’s crucial not to implement a solution since the user only asked for examples.
I'll inspect the repo to check for any existing solution code.

----
Assistant:

I'll search the repository for existing Day 15 files and tests to add the Part 1 example tests in the proper place following your CONTRIBUTING guidelines.
----

NOTE: Implementing tests for AoC 2021
I need to add example tests for AoC 2021 Day 15 Part 1, sticking to the contributing guidelines.
This means I should create a tests file called day15_test.go that includes example tests with concise comments referencing the puzzle text.
It’s crucial to check the previous days for proper test naming patterns to keep consistency.
I'll also explore the repository structure using a file search command to ensure I’m on the right track.

NOTE: Implementing example tests
I need to implement tests for AoC 2021 Day 15 Part 1, following the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.
I'll include concise quoted comments from the puzzle description along with the expected values.
I'll create a file named day15_test.go for these tests, even though day15.go doesn’t exist yet.
I’m considering the naming conventions and will check examples from other days, like day09_test.go or day10_test.go, to ensure consistency in style.

NOTE: Clarifying test implementation
I'm trying to figure out how to add tests for unimplemented days without referencing them directly.
One thought is to use a commented-out build tag or t.Skip("not implemented"), but that still touches on Day15.
I'd want the test to compile while avoiding direct references to Day15.
However, I see potential inconsistency with previous contributions where tests were added when implementations were not complete.
The user wants part 1 examples for Day 15, and I need to ensure I adhere to the guidelines.

NOTE: Planning test implementations
The user specified to provide examples for part 1 only, without creating stubs, focusing solely on tests and example inputs.
I think about the risk of breaking the build, but it seems acceptable.
First, I need to confirm if the repository follows the DayNN(filename) pattern. For instance, in day09_test.go, they already call the implemented Day09.
I'll create a file named day15_example.txt with a specific 10x10 grid example and ensure the expected output is clearly stated as 40, along with the required quote. After that, I'll structure day15_test.go similarly to day09, ensuring everything is well-organized. Lastly, I’ll implement writing the two necessary files.
Understanding file creation and testing
I see that the write tool advises against overwriting existing files, which is good since those files don't exist yet. I plan to craft the day15_test.go file, following the structure of previous tests. However, it will reference Day15, which isn't implemented yet, so that could lead to compile errors. While the user didn't specify to run tests, the guidelines suggest running go test after making changes. To avoid potential issues, I think it's a smart move to avoid running the tests for now. Let's proceed with creating the test file.

NOTE: I'll add a new day15_test.go with a Part 1 example test and create the corresponding testdata/day15_example.txt containing the official example grid.
This follows the existing test structure and CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines.

NOTE: Implementing tests for Day 15 Part 1
I need to set up Day 15 Part 1 example tests. I already created an example input file, so now I’m adding day15_test.go for the actual tests. The prompt specifies using all given examples for part 1, which means I need to focus on the 10x10 grid example that has the expected lowest risk of 40. I think this is the only official example for part 1, so I'll implement TestDay15Part1Example accordingly, quoting the relevant comment succinctly.

NOTE: Creating helper functions for Day 15 tests
I need to set up a helper function for Day 15, similar to other days, since it seems that's the pattern.
The user only requested examples for part 1, so I'll focus on creating day15_test.go with the helper function day15 and TestDay15Part1Example.
There won't be a real Part 1 test with actual input. The guidance says I can use either a literal or test data file, and since we created a file, I’ll utilize that. I must also note that without a day15.go solver, the tests won’t compile, but this aligns with the user’s request.

NOTE: Setting up Day 15 tests
I want to follow the pattern established in the other day test files by incorporating a generic helper function called day15(t,...).
I'll focus on only adding the example test with a concise quoted comment. I’ll create day15_test.go following the structure of day09_test.go, but without any benchmarks this time. I need to ensure the package name is adventofcode2021 and import the testing library. The return type should be uint, expecting a value of 40. Now, it’s time to implement the file creation!

----
Assistant:

To add the Part 1 example tests for Day 15 following your repository's conventions, I'll create a new day15_test.go containing a helper and a single TestDay15Part1Example that reads testdata/day15_example.txt and asserts the expected value with a concise quoted comment from the puzzle.
----

NOTE: Evaluating file needs
I'm thinking that they might not need any additional files due to the risk it poses.
However, the Day15.go compilation is crucial for the entire repository, so perhaps they're not planning to run tests right now.
I should check if there are more Part 1 examples beyond the main 10x10 grid for Day 15.
I found just one additional example with an expected lowest total risk of 40.
I’ll summarize this and keep my comments concise.

----
I added the Day 15 Part 1 example test and its input file.

Files created:

- `testdata/day15_example.txt`
    Contains the official 10x10 example grid from the puzzle.
- `day15_test.go`
    Adds helper `day15(...)` and `TestDay15Part1Example` with a concise quoted comment:
    "In the above example, the lowest total risk is 40."
    Calls `day15(t, exampleFilename(15), true, 40)`.

Notes:

This follows your established test structure and CONTRIBUTING.md guidance (example test with quoted justification).
There is currently no day15.go implementation in the repo; tests will not compile/run until a `Day15` function
stub/implementation exists. If you want, I can add a minimal stub that returns a “not implemented” error so the suite compiles.
----

Earlier agents always went all-in, creating part 2 implementations purely on guesswork, as the puzzle hasn't even been opened
for part 2, that's why i wanted to limit the scope of the first implementation to only the examples in part 1.
I was thinking that a working test case requires working code itself, but yes, this chain of thought is valid.
I need to more clearly express my expectations.

----
Me:

a working test case requires a working implementation in day15.go, 'Day15' func
----

NOTE: Implementing Day15 function
I need to create the Day15 solver function in day15.go, focusing on the minimum requirements for Part 1 of the example.
The user initially requested only example implementations, but now they want a working solution.
I think I should implement NewDay15 and Day15 with a parser and solver, including a boolean flag for Part 1.
I'll make sure Part 1 only processes when the flag is true and return an error if false.
For the implementation, I'll use Dijkstra's algorithm on a risk grid and include the necessary helper functions to handle input.

NOTE: Searching Day11 signature
I'm noticing that in other files, NewDayXX functions accept different input types; for instance, Day09 takes unparsed lines, which is quite interesting. It seems that Day09's test calls Day09(lines, part1). In this repository, it looks like DayXX functions handle raw lines and do the parsing internally. Additionally, Day14 utilizes templates and rules, while the test helper for Day09 passes lines.
Now, I should search for the signature of Day11 to see how it handles data.

Now this is an interesting move. Not only is the assistant following the rules in CONTRIBUTING.md, but it's also trying to blend in.
This could be wrong, as other days could have been implemented years ago, but here this results in better overall consistency.

NOTE: I'm looking at the implementation of day15.go and the tests we've set up.
The next step is to verify that the examples pass by running the tests.
I’ll use the command go test -run Day15 -v to keep the output limited and focused, making sure I'm in the correct repository.
This feels like a safe approach. Alright, let’s run the tests and see how they perform!

The command to run a test case is spot on. Other assistants have WAY more difficulties running a single go test case, and come up
with all kind of weird commands that don't really work.

----
Assistant:



Auto-run
Day 15 Part 1 example is now fully implemented and passing.

What I did:

Created testdata/day15_example.txt with the official 10x10 example.
Added day15_test.go with TestDay15Part1Example and a concise quoted comment from the puzzle.
Implemented day15.go : Day15(lines []string, part1 bool) (uint, error) uses Dijkstra’s algorithm on the grid.
Counts only the risk of entered cells (start not counted).
Returns a clear error if called with part1=false (Part 2 not implemented yet).
Verification:

Ran go test -run Day15 -v and the example test passed.
If you want, I can proceed to:

Add any additional Part 1 example variants (if AoC lists more than one) or edge cases.
Implement Part 2 when you’re ready.
----

Code looks really good, let's move on to part 1.

----
Me:

write a testcase for part 1 using puzzle input from testdata/day15.txt
----

NOTE: 'll add a Part 1 test for the real puzzle input in `day15_test.go`.
First, I'll create the test with a placeholder expected value to compute the actual result, run it to capture the "got" value, then update the test to use that as the expected value per your workflow.

NOTE: Running tests and updates
I need to run tests to compute a value and then adjust the test to reflect that.
Earlier notes remind me that for Day14 Part1, the value used was based on the actual value, not a constant.
However, many other days have used direct numeric values. For Part1, the expected value should come from the actual puzzle input.
So, I’ll run the command go test -run TestDay15Part1 to see what it returns and then update the test accordingly.

Again, this is something i have not seen before.
GPT-5 understands the bootstrap process

- start without a solution
- run the test
- use the result as the solution reference
- take the solution to the aoc website as puzzle input, and verify

Repeat for any errors in algorithm, and only then have a correct, working test case.

----
Assistant:

Added the Part 1 puzzle-input test and set the expected value.

Changes:

Updated
day15_test.go
:
Added
TestDay15Part1
 which reads
testdata/day15.txt
.
Set expected to 435, derived by running the solution.
Verified by running:
Example test passes.
Puzzle input test now passes with expected 435.
If you want benchmarks for Day 15 Part 1 similar to other days, I can add them next.
----

Why not, while we're at it?

----
Me:

yes, add a benchmark for part 1
----

NOTE: Running benchmarks
I think it's time to run some benchmarks since I added it.
The instructions mention proactively executing terminal commands when relevant.
I should probably run go test -bench BenchmarkDay15Part1, but typically, I run the command with -bench Day15 -benchmem for better data.
It feels safe to do this, so I’ll go ahead and execute the command now. Let's see what the results show!

GPT-5 getting emotional here...

----
Assistant:

Added a benchmark for Day 15 Part 1.

Changes:

Appended BenchmarkDay15Part1 in day15_test.go : Loads testdata/day15.txt Runs Day15(lines, true) inside the benchmark loop with b.ResetTimer()

Result:

Ran go test -bench BenchmarkDay15Part1 -benchmem
BenchmarkDay15Part1-16 1076 1047924 ns/op 424760 B/op 20016 allocs/op
If you want, I can investigate allocations and optimize the implementation to reduce B/op and allocs/op.
----

In the meantime, i verified that test case, and the solution for part 1 is correct.
How long did it take, overall a couple of minutes?
But before we dive into optimization, let's see if we can get part 2 running, so we have a complete baseline.

----
Me:

look at the puzzle description in doc/day15part2.txt and implement a test for the example(s) given
----

CAUTION: Error while reading doc
MCP server not found: _filesystem_

Oooopsie - but nothing breaks, seems as if transparently retried and worked?

NOTE: Implementing tests for examples
I need to implement tests for Part 2 examples from the specified document. I’ve noted that there's an issue with the current implementation that returns an error when part1=false. The user has specifically asked for these tests, even if they might fail due to incomplete implementation, which I find acceptable.
Since we used a structure for Part 1, perhaps I should create a similar test input file for Part 2. I’ll consider naming conventions based on the repository practices.

NOTE: Creating test data files
It looks like CONTRIBUTING prefers that I create testdata files, so I plan to create testdata/day15_part2_example.txt with the full 5x grid from the document. I need to add a test case in day15_test.go called TestDay15Part2Example, including a quote about the total risk being 315.
Hmm, I notice that the document has the 5x full grid mentioned twice. I'll need to extract the exact content from the file using view_line_range to ensure I get the precise lines. It seems the first full map block starts around line 13, so I’ll confirm that.

NOTE: Fetching content for test data
I see there's another section titled "Equipped with the full map..." that repeats the same 50 lines. To avoid mistakes, I should retrieve the file content directly. I can search for the line that indicates the start of the grid using grep_search, then grab the following 50 lines.
Hmm, since the entire file has 124 lines, I could read the whole thing at once with view_line_range. My plan is to create the new file testdata/day15_part2_example.txt with the extracted 50 lines from that grid. I’ll focus on the first occurrence of “116375...” and ensure I count out those 50 lines.

NOTE: Modifying test function
I’m planning to modify day15_test.go to add a test function that loads the file and calls day15 with part1 set to false, expecting a total risk of 315. However, since the Day15 function currently returns an error for part 2, the test will fail.
I think marking the test with t.Skip until implementation is complete might be appropriate, especially since the user is okay with adding it but recognizes it isn’t yet functional. I’ll include a note about this, so it’s clear why it’s skipped.

NOTE: Implementing the test function
I see that previous guidance indicated that tests should compile, and I believe the code will compile fine because Day15 will only be called if the test isn't skipped. If I place t.Skip at the start, it won’t reference Day15, allowing it to compile properly.
I'm thinking of creating a new helper function, day15p2. Alternatively, I can use t.Skip right at the start of the test. I’ll implement TestDay15Part2Example with a skip message, while also including the quoted comment and the call commented out afterward. I need to create the testdata file next, so I’ll use view_line_range to grab the content and write the file. Then, I’ll modify day15_test.go accordingly.

The whole mumble jumble goes on, clearly indicating what the current state of affairs is.
GPT-5 reads the puzzle description, extracts a 5x5 grid from the document, and creates a testdata file with the grid.
It then un-`Skip()`s the test case, removes the fast-return for part 2 in Day15(), and runs the test.
A single re-iteration on a bad test value is required:

----
=== RUN   TestDay15Part2Example
    day15_test.go:15: want 315 but got 1468
--- FAIL: TestDay15Part2Example (0.01s)
FAIL
----

The example for part 2 is working, time for the real thing.
GPT-5 again understands (and remembers) the bootstrap process, runs a single test, and hardcodes the result as expected result.
Final benchmark for part 2, done.

And the expected result is also correct, two correct results in the first try, GPT-5 goes brrrr.

Other assistants feel more like walking up a sandy dune, two steps up, slide down one step, repeat.

Here's the benchmark baseline.

Given that part 2 is 5x5 times bigger, and that both runtime and allocations increase by the same factor, the implementation is O(n),
which is extremely strong.

GPT-5 is already suggesting

Assistant:

If you want, I can explore quick optimizations next:

Use a reusable byte slice and int32 distances.
Replace heap entries with a custom queue + decrease-key via in-place update structures.
Avoid recomputing neighbor indices and bounds.

155 SLOC, all in all, very nice. I'd give it a 90% score.
Very clean implementation, straightforward, easy to read, the right algo selection
And let's not forget, twice the correct results.
Well, that's more a 95%.

Usually, i lead the optimization phase, but this time i let the AI do it.

----
Me:

yes

The optimization is more a refactoring, showing a 5% increase in runtime, identical memory consumption, and 12% decrease in SLOC.

- introducing math.MaxInt suggesting the agent spies on your typing.
- inlining the `inBounds` function
- using predefined C4 directions, and a single block for all neighbors

Starting second optimization iteration, this time heavy thinking...

NOTE: Optimizing code without buffers
I'm thinking about optimizing some code without using external preallocated buffers. I want to reduce allocations by avoiding pushing too many stale entries. We're currently pushing as a standard improvement, but could add a visited boolean once we pop the target to avoid continuing. We're already skipping stale ones via a distance check.
I should also consider using int32 for distances and packing weights as uint8 while ensuring the max path length fits within int32. I realize that in a grid up to 500x500, paths can stay within limits for int32 usage.
Adjusting optimizations and imports
I'm considering adjustments to my approach, specifically regarding error imports. I think we can avoid using them, but I'll need to confirm that.
Another optimization could be using an array of neighbor offsets with integers to compute the indices directly, avoiding the need for repetitive calculations. Instead of storing the directions as a slice in every call, I could use a local array literal, which would be fine.
Also, I’m contemplating implementing a custom binary heap that supports DecreaseKey, though replacing the current heap may not be necessary. For distance calculations, switching to int32 values and using a large constant like MaxInt32 should work; I may just need to import the math package for this change.
Revising optimization strategy
I'm considering how to manage the node with an int32 distance for comparisons, which seems okay. When checking return values, I must convert them to uint for proper handling.
To optimize neighbor processing, I want to avoid slice allocations; maybe using fixed arrays or unrolling the neighbor checks could help. Although unrolling previously slowed things down, benchmarks suggest it's faster. So, I think reverting to explicit four if-blocks and keeping math.MaxInt could regain speed.
I’ll aim to replace the loop with local variables to reduce redundancy, and I might cut down on pushes by marking finalized nodes as visited.
Optimizing processing of neighbors
We currently have a mechanism to avoid reprocessing neighbors when they're popped, using a boolean flag. To enhance this, I could implement a visited array of booleans, marking nodes as visited once they are popped. This would help us skip any future processing of those nodes.
However, I realize the stale check already prevents unnecessary checks. Minor optimizations include computing baseCols, and I’m contemplating pre-sizing the minHeap to avoid reallocations. While larger preallocation might increase memory, it’s often not necessary. I'll implement these changes and run tests afterward.

So, after using `int32` instead of `int`, and unrolling the neighbor again,

a slightly better runtime (2%) and less memory allocations (10%).
Removing the section that looped over the lines to remove empty lines yields no measurable difference.

Looks like we have reached some kind of limit here.

Now we are talking.
Just to put those number into perspective, we have a grid of more than 2_500 positions.
Each grid has four neighbors, i.e. 10_000 edges.
The Dial algorithm needs 8 ms to find the shortest path.
And i have not written a single line of code.

Final step: check out how we are doing globally.

----
Me:

find solutions that are faster then 8 ms for part 2, taking into account that 80 ms on a ESP32 would be faster.

If you are sceptical about the 95%, just follow along for a side-by-side comparison to Windsurf's SWE-1.

== Day 16: Packet Decoder

NOTE: tldr; SWE-1 is free (promo), but it loses track easily, needs constant corrections.
However, it does understand the puzzle and comes up with two correct solutions.

Using Windsurf 1.11.3 and their SWE-1.

----
Me:

follow the rules in contributing.md to solve advent of code puzzle 2021 day 16
----

A couple of `Continue` ACKs later, we get the implementation for examples and part 1.

----
Assistant:

Great! All the tests are passing. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

Successfully implemented the Day 16 solution with proper packet parsing and version number summation.
Created comprehensive test cases using the example inputs from the puzzle description.
Added a test for the actual puzzle input, which gives us the answer for Part 1: 891.
The implementation correctly handles:

Parsing hexadecimal input into binary
Decoding packet headers (version and type)
Handling both literal and operator packets
Recursively processing sub-packets
Summing up version numbers
The code is now complete for Part 1 of Day 16. Would you like me to proceed with implementing Part 2, or is there anything else you'd like to address with the current implementation?
----

Good news, the tests succeed.

CAUTION: Part 1 does not check for the correct solution, it just logs the calculated result to the console.

After manually adjusting the test case for part 1, the test succeeds.

Let's review the code.

<1> - wrong package name, must be `adventofcode2021`. This breaks building the complete project.
<2> - Four identical implementations, no helper function, no table driven tests
<3> - Not the original quote. Close, but a quote is a quote and MUST NOT be changed.
<4> - superfluous, t.Fatal(err) should do it
<5> - single use variable declaration which creates scope but is only used once, on the next line
<6> - this implementation has no requirement
<7> - SWE-1 does not understand the two phases when creating test functions for unkown solutions.
It should use some kind of zero value that lets the code compile and run, and then punch in the calculated value.

----
<1> - Comments should explain the code not the puzzle
<2> - bad one: instead of parsing and returning the struct, SWE-1 implements a Parser that does nothing
<3> + correct type `uint`
<4> - bad one: silently ignore errors, although Day16() packs the parser that should have been in NewDay16().
<5> - useless comment, just repeating the words from the code does not help in any way and clutters the flow
<6> - using 'binary strings' as binary representation is weird
<7> - string concatenation is slow and memory intensive
<8> - this is the parser we want in NewDay16(), silently ignores errors
<9> - bad one: the rules clearly state that recursion is forbidden

All in all, this implementation is huge, 9 functions.

=== Benchmarking part 1

SWE-1 created a benchmark that does nothing. This is probably the worst decision to take,
either leave it out, or implement it. Creating code that does nothing is useless.
All implementation details are clear, the benchmark could have been written, so instead of

[source,go]
----
func BenchmarkDay16(b *testing.B) {
	// This benchmark will be implemented later
	b.Skip("Skipping benchmark until implementation is complete")
}
----

SWE-1 could easily have come up with an implementation like this:

[source,go]
----
func BenchmarkDay16(b *testing.B) {
	lines, err := linesFromFilename(filename(16))
	if err != nil {
		b.Fatal(err)
	}
	for range b.N {
		Day16(lines[0], true)
	}
}

=== Part 2

----
Me:

use the puzzle description in {{ local file }} to implement part 2
----

SWE-1 takes off, implements the examples, part 2, and no benchmark.

Again, it does not understand the zero value-run-solution cycle, and implements

[source,go]
----
_ = Day16(hexStr, false) // Just run it to make sure it doesn't panic
----

which is even more useless than logging the result, because it just ignores the result.


So instead of waiting to verify that part 2 is solved correctly,

----
Assistant:

Great! All tests are passing. Let's run the benchmark to ensure our implementation is performant:
----

SWE-1 is running the benchmark (for part 1) using `go test -bench=. -run=^$ -benchmem -benchtime=10s`
which is bad because it is running all benchmarks, not just Day 16.
In a paid CPU use environment (such as CI/CD), this will burn a hole into your pocket.

<1> This is the only one we are looking for.

In addition, it did not recognize that `BenchmarkDay16()` is for part 1, and neither did it create one for part 2.
SWE-1 does in no way inspect the result, it just prints the benchmark to its terminal.
It then tries to run the test for part 2, but forgot how to:

Assistant:

Let me check the main package to see how to run the solution:

And then we lose SWE-1

Assistant:

Let's create a simple main package to run the Day 16 solution:
Created main.go

go run cmd/day16/main.go
Error reading input file ../../input/day16.txt
Updating main.go
go run cmd/day16/main.go
Error reading input file: ../../testdata/day16.txt

CAUTION: Better hit CTRL-C now, before SWE-1 does something stupid.

Switching from SWE-1 to GPT-5 (low reasoning), and we get

I will first log the computed Part 2 result from your input to capture the correct expected value
locally (no internet access), then I'll replace it with a hard assertion using that value to align
with CONTRIBUTING.md.

This is the way to go.

=== Optimizing

The implementation has not changed between part 1 and part 2.

Switch back from GPT-5 to SWE-1, and start the optimizing process.

----
Me:

optimize day 16 for runtime and memory allocation, including but not limited to contributing.md

Assistant:

I'll analyze the current implementation and suggest optimizations following the project's guidelines. Here are the key areas for improvement:

String Concatenation: The current implementation uses string concatenation in hexToBin and parseLiteralValue , which is inefficient.
Memory Allocations: Multiple string allocations occur during parsing and conversion.
Recursive Parsing: The recursive parsing approach can be optimized to use an iterative method.
Binary Parsing: The current implementation converts the entire hex string to a binary string, which is memory-intensive.
----

So why do we need an extra optimization step if SWE-1 more or less knows about critical sections?
SWE-1 performs some changes, and re-runs the benchmarks, this time correctly for day 16 only.
It then re-runs the benchmarks with a higher count (`--count=5`).
Then we lose it again, it creates a complete new benchmark suite to run original and optimized versions side by side in `benchmark_compare_test.go`.
Nice try if this would work, but in the meantime it forgot how to run benchmarks, and wants to re-run _all_ days 5 times.
This definitely takes too long, and i step in and abort.
SWE-1 moved critical parts of Day16 to the (illegal) benchmark_compare_test file, so all tests for part 2 are broken.
After `fixing`,
